# Building Custom Bootstrap Cards with Shiny

This repository contains the materials associated with the proposed talk at the 2022 Appsilon Shiny Conference.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine

2.  Open the [shiny-custom-bscard.Rproj](shiny-custom-bscard.Rproj) file
    from the directory on your local machine where you cloned this
    repository. This should install the {renv} package if you do not
    already have it installed, but if you donâ€™t see that happen in the
    console, run `install.packages("renv")`.

3.  Run `renv::restore()` to install the package dependencies needed to
    run this app successfully

4.  Open the [app.R](app.R) file and execute the code in that script to
    launch the app
