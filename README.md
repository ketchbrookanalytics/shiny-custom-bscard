# Building Custom Bootstrap Cards with Shiny

This repository contains the materials associated with [Michael Thomas'](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljthomas2/) tutorial, *"Building Custom Bootstrap Cards with Shiny"* at the [2022 Appsilon Shiny Conference](https://hopin.com/events/shinyconference2022#schedule).

## Purpose

The goal of the tutorial is to teach learners how to translate HTML + CSS code into R code via the `{shiny}` family of functions that map directly to HTML tags.

At the end of the tutorial, users should be comfortable seeing a chunk of HTML code (e.g., `<h3>Hello World</h3>`) and generating the R code equivalent (in this case, `shiny::h3("Hello World")`).

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine

2.  Open the [shiny-custom-bscard.Rproj](shiny-custom-bscard.Rproj) file
    from the directory on your local machine where you cloned this
    repository. This should install the {renv} package if you do not
    already have it installed, but if you donâ€™t see that happen in the
    console, run `install.packages("renv")`.

3.  Run `renv::restore()` to install the package dependencies needed to
    run this app successfully

4.  Open the [app.R](app.R) file and execute the code in that script to
    launch the app
